/COM,ANSYS RELEASE 2021 R1           BUILD 21.1      UP20201109       12:45:16

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.000   TIME= 12:45:16
 The requested number of shared-memory processors (32) exceeds the       
 number of physical processors that are available (6).  As the use of    
 virtual processors is not recommended, the number of processors used    
 will be 6.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.078   TIME= 12:45:25
 The requested number of shared-memory processors (32) cannot be greater 
 than that specified by the ANSYS command line option -NP (6).           
  The number of processors used will be left at 6.                       

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.797   TIME= 12:45:25
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.938   TIME= 12:45:26
 Material number 2 (used by element 23337) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      80.547   TIME= 12:45:54
 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 1.356968466E-09 is less than a      
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.
